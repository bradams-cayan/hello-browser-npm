<h1>JavaScript the Old Way</h1>

<p>The older way of writing JavaScript was just to include different script tags. Those tags might be different libraries or a JavaScript file you wrote.</p>

<h3>The Old Way</h3>
<p>
    Step 1: Include a script tag.
</p>

<p>
    Step 2: Write your JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
    Step 3: That's it!
</p>

<p>
    Step 4: Note this could get very complicated as your project starts to rely on lots of other libraries and other dependencies, or has lots of its own files. Then just including script tags isn't so simple anymore...
